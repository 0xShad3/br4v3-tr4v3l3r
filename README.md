# br4v3-tr4v3l3r
An RPG game to play on your toaster ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Hello there, as I said that's a game that you can play on your toaster, its mostly fun made but we also tried to implement some concepts of a real like app that will help each one of us differently. 
- Multithreading on the Server's Backend.
- Implementation of a custom game network protocol.
- C skills sharpening (Shad3 approves).
- Debugging the app on the fly.


## Compilation and running
To compile and run the game simply copy and paste the following commands (assuming you are on a Linux environment)
```c
 git clone https://github.com/0xShad3/br4v3-tr4v3l3r.git
 cd br4v3-tr4v3l3r
 make game.bin 
 make server.bin

```
This will give you as output 2 binaries. It is preferable to run the server binary on port 9999 since that`s the default port that clients are trying to connect to.

## Disclaimer

We higly recommend you to run this and have fun with our mini game. But we suggest you to not expose this under no circumstances out of your local network if you dont know what you are doing this may harm you since this piece of software is probably vulnerable to multiple vulnerabilities that may even result to Remote Command Execution.
